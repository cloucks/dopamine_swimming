## Analysis of swimming-induced paralysis (SWIP) in *Caenorhabditis elegans* 

###Summary

Wild-type *C. elegans* are able to swim in a liquid (M9 or water) for an extended period of time, while mutants that have excessive dopamine signalling, such as *dat-1* animals with defects in the dopamine re-uptake transporter, show high levels of paralysis after 10 minutes. In addition, these animals show decreased thrashing frequency compared to wild-type animals across the entire 10 minutes. This analysis was made to look at novel mutants to assess the possibility of increased dopamine signalling.

###Experimental set-up

This work uses the Multi-worm tracker (Swierczek et al., 2011).
